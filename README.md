# Entailment classification
In this repository we use the [Standford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) and deep recurrent neural networks to perform textual entailment classification. We discuss diferent models and give a pytorch implementation of them using torchtext.
